**Celebrate Student Scholarship at Monmouth University**

Monmouth University Passport makes it easy to engage with Student Scholarship Week—an annual celebration showcasing students' academic work, research, creative projects, and scholarly contributions across all disciplines.

Use the app to track your attendance, support your peers, and participate in the week-long recognition of student achievement.

**About Student Scholarship Week**
Now in its 9th year, Student Scholarship Week highlights faculty-student collaboration and celebrates scholarly work inside and outside the classroom. Events include:

• **Hawk Talks** - TED-style presentations and poster exhibitions featuring research from all academic disciplines
• **Honors capstone presentations** - Final research projects from Honors School students
• **Theater productions** - Student-led performances showcasing directing, choreography, and design
• **Art exhibitions** - Visual arts displays and creative projects
• **Service learning showcases** - Community engagement and clinical experiences
• **Departmental symposia** - Discipline-specific research presentations
• **Study abroad presentations** - International academic experiences

**How the App Works:**
✓ Sign in with your Monmouth University account
✓ View the complete schedule of Scholarship Week events
✓ Scan QR codes at events to record your attendance
✓ Track how many events you've attended
✓ See where you rank among participants
✓ Top attendees receive recognition and prizes (Dunkin' gift cards and more)

**Why Attend More Events?**
The real value isn't in the app—it's in showing up. By attending events across different disciplines, you:
• Discover research and creative work outside your major
• Support classmates presenting their scholarship
• Engage with faculty mentors and their students
• Explore potential academic interests and collaborations
• Experience the breadth of intellectual work at Monmouth

The leaderboard and prizes simply encourage you to attend events you might otherwise miss.

**Event Attendance Tracking**
Each event displays a unique QR code. Scan it with the app to confirm your attendance. Your total events and ranking update in real-time throughout the week. The app replaces manual sign-in sheets while providing instant feedback on participation.

**Privacy & Data**
We collect only what's necessary: your student ID, event attendance records, and optional display name for the leaderboard. Data is stored securely via Google Firebase. See the full privacy policy in-app.

**Requirements**
• Active Monmouth University student credentials
• Available during annual Student Scholarship Week (typically April)

This app serves Student Scholarship Week's core mission: celebrating and promoting engagement with student academic achievement across the university.
